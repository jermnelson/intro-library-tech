    <h2>World Web Web</h2>
    <p>From it's beginnings on a CERN desktop computer, the World Web Web (WWW)
      impact on all levels of society has been profound and libraries are still
      reacting to the introduction of websites, the availablity of information,
      and important to library systems, user expectations surrounding functionality
      and interface norms.</p>
    <h3>Amazon, Google, and Wikipedia</h3>
      <p>
        Both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> (founded in 1994) and
        <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a> (founded in 1998) heavily influnce
        the expectations of library technology users. Amazon's display of books
        search results and detailed page views using such user interface
        conventions as facets to filter results, all impacted the design of
        library technologies. Google contextual searching was different from the
        access-points based search of library ILS and provided better search
        results for many queries that are difficult to replicate in the ILS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ongoing success of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> as
        a resource built with user-contributed content, forced libraries to
        reconsider their traditional roles as information gatekeepers.

    <h2>OPAC</h2>
    <p>
      The arrival of "Online Public Access Catalog" or (OPAC) that provided a web-based
      interface to ILS started in the mid-1990s. Almost immediately, these often
      primitive OPACS were much more popular among library users than the
      physical card catalog or first-generation "text-based" catalogs of the
      1970s and 1980s. The designs of these early OPACs reflected two different
      access models, one deeply ground in assumptions and behavior of using the
      physical card catalog with author, title, and subject access points while <thead>
      other was using console-based information sources like DIALOG.

    <h3>SearchWorks</h3>
    <p>DLSS's <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/">SearchWorks</a> is
      one of the best implementations of a Discovery environment.</p>

    <h3>Discovery Layers/Systems</h3>
    <img src="/intro-library-tech/static/img/blacklight-logo.svg"
         style="float: right; width: 45%">
    <p>
     Discovery systems, both open-source (<a href="http://projectblacklight.org/"> Blacklight</a>, VuFind)
     or commercial products like Innovative Interfaces' Encore, Ex Libris Summon,
     OCLC's WorldCat Local, and Ebsco's Discovery Service. All of these
     systems attempt to replicate a "Google" like search with puesdo-boolean
     searches on indexes that include the library's catalog, digital repositories,
     and purchased and opens-access article index and full-text databases.
   </p>
   <h3>Institutional Repositories</h3>
   <p>
     Institutional Digital Repositories are a class of software for preserving and
     accessing digital content. Most library vendors offer commerical institutional
     repository products with the biggest change was the purchase of
     <a href="https://www.bepress.com/">Bepress</a> by Elsevier.
   </p>
   <p>
     The open-source <a href="https://duraspace.org/fedora/">Fedora Repository</a> is the backend digital
     repository that has two major front-ends; Hydra and Islandora.
     <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-digital-repository">Stanford
       Digital Repository</a> uses a legacy version of Fedora to store MODS XML
       metadata but not for management of the resource bitstreams.
    </p>
    <p>Every year, Marshall Breedings produces a report on library systems that
       breaks down the major vendors and developments in library technology.
