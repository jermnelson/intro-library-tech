<h1>Glossary</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access Points</strong> are the software "hooks" in the library catalog where patrons are able to search to look up the item.
    Typical Access Points include author, title, and subject. With the advent of Discovery Layers/Systems, more of the MARC
    records is exposed for searching.
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow">BIBFRAME</a></strong>, short for bibliographic framework, is a Library of
Congress sponsored vocabulary for modeling bibliographic entities and relationships for library physical and digital collections.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery Layers/Systems</strong> a catagory of library systems with <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/" rel="nofollow">Blacklight</a> being one of the most<br>
popular, that provide a faceted search built upon full-text search indexing using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="nofollow">Solr</a> or
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://dublincore.org/" rel="nofollow">Dublin Core</a></strong> a basic metadata vocabulary with a simple, flat structure with common elements
like creator, title, format, and date that is the most widely metadata vocabulary used in range of industries beyond libraries.</li>
<li><strong>ILS</strong> short for Integrated Library System, is the predominate enterprise software used by Libraries to manage their
collections. Typically, an ILS has multiple functions for different library functions like acquisitions, cataloging,
circulation, and other library functions.</li>
<li><strong>LCSH</strong> short for Library of Congress Subject Headings, is a controlled vocabulary of subject headings or terms that are
organized in a hiearchical fashion and are typically grouped from more general to more specific headings in a left-to-right
order.</li>
<li><strong>Linked Data</strong> a generic term associated with RDF data and related technologies with emphasis on data sharing between
different institutions instead of duplicative services and data silos that is the current practice in cataloging and
insitutional library systems.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/" rel="nofollow">MARC</a></strong> short for <strong>MA</strong>chine-<strong>R</strong>eadable <strong>C</strong>ataloging is the original data interchange
format for libraries that was initially created in the late 1960s that is still the dominate representation for
bibliographic information in use by libraries. The current version is called MARC21 while MARC XML is a serialization format
that represents MARC as XML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/" rel="nofollow">MODS</a></strong> short for <em>Metadata Object Description Schema</em> is an XML vocabulary published
by Library of Congress for describing typically born digital or digitalized objects like images. This schema is used primarily
in digital repositories and not library catalogs.</li>
<li><strong>OPAC</strong> is an acronym for <em>online public access catalog</em> for an ILS service that public web access to a library's catalog.</li>
<li><strong>RDF</strong> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/" rel="nofollow">Resource Description Framework</a>, is an W3C specification for describing data to faciliate
data interchange on the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Web</strong> a term introduced in a 2001 Sir Tim Berners-Lee <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/2001/05-01/" rel="nofollow">paper</a>
of the same name, is a vision of machine-actionable data embedded with web resources for richer functionality and user interfaces
than the current (at that time) static web.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://schema.org/" rel="nofollow">schema.org</a></strong> a metadata vocabulary co-sponsored by Google, Microsoft, and Yandex for semantically
marking up web resources with linked data.</li>
<li><strong>SPARQL</strong> query language for RDF and currently supported by full-featured RDF triplestores that allows for both simple and
complex queries againest RDF triples using a syntax that is similar to both SQL and the RDF turtle serialization.</li>
<li><strong>Triples</strong> or <strong>RDF Triples</strong> is the basic structure of RDF. Each triple statement is made up of three components,
a <em>subject</em> made up of an IRI (Internet Resource Identifier) or Blank Node, a <em>predicate</em> made up an IRI, and an <em>object</em>
made up either an IRI, Blank Node, or literal value.</li>
<li><strong>Triplestore</strong> a data storage technology for RDF triples, popular triplestores include
<a href="https://www.blazegraph.com/" rel="nofollow">Blazegraph</a>, Apache <a href="https://jena.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Jena</a>, <a href="https://www.marklogic.com/" rel="nofollow">MarkLogic</a>,
and Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/" rel="nofollow">Neptune</a>.</li>
