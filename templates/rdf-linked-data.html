      The <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a> is
      an international effort to bring machine-readable data to the web called linked
      data and was initially proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in a 2001 article.
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF">RDF</a> (Resource Description
      Framework) is a W3C specification that describes the model used to construct
      a directed graph that can be searched and manipulated using
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> query language.
    </p>
    <p>
      RDF graphs made up a series of statements, called RDF triples.
      In a RDF triple, the first element is called a <strong>subject</strong> and represents a
      resource with the second element, the <strong>predicate</strong>, describing
      an aspect that connects to the third element, an <strong>object</strong>
      made up a value, blank node, or IRI. One or more these triple statements
      make up a RDF graph.

      <h4>International Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</h4>
      <p>
          Linked Data is is based on the idea behind the common URL,
          the uniform resource locator, used everyday when using the web.
          Internationalized Resource Identifier or <strong>IRI</strong> extend
          the concept of URL to use IRI as a global identifier and unlike a URL,
          an IRI can contain unicode characters from other non-European languages.
          An IRI serves as the critical linking data structure between local and
          global information sources. <strong>NOTE</strong> an IRI need not exist
          to be useful, only that it is uniquely and globally identifiable like
          an URL.
      </p>

    <h3>Subject Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be either an IRI or a blank node</li>
      <li>Represents a resource or entity</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Predicate Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can only be an IRI</li>
      <li>Is a relationship between the subject and object</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Object Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be either an IRI or a blank node</li>
      <li>Is the property value of a resource or entity</li>

<h2>SPARQL &amp; Serialization Formats</h2>
<article id="sparql-formats">
  <section>
    <p>The value of RDF Linked Data comes when it is paired with a
      Triplestore that supports the RDF query language,
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a> (short for
      SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language), allows for sophisticated
      retrieval of data within the triplestore as well as an means to
      manipulate the data by adding, editing, or deleting triples contained in
      the triplestore.
    </p>
    <p>With RDF <strong>predicates</strong> restricted to IRIs, multiple
      RDF vocabularies can be used in the same graph with potential different
      semantic statements being asserted about the same <strong>subject</strong>.
      SPARQL easily handles multiple vocabularies like
      <a href='https://schema.org/'>Schema.org</a> and
      <a href="#bibframe">BIBFRAME</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, RDF graphs support different serialization methods for both
      input and export of data. The RDF XML serialization was the first method
      followed by N3, Turtle, and JSON-LD.

<h2>BIBFRAME Vocabulary</h2>
<p>
  A RDF vocabulary initiated by the Library of Congress in 2011, BIBFRAME,
  short for Bibliographic Framework, is in it's second version and is the
  bases for Linked Data for Libraries Production and other related projects.
</p>
<article id="bibframe">
  <section>
    <p>BIBFRAME is made up three primary classes, <strong>Work</strong>,
      <strong>Instance</strong>, and <strong>Item</strong> and a number of
      secondary, supporting classes.
    </p>
  <h3>BIBFRAME Work</h3>
  <strong>Definition</strong>: <em>The highest level of abstraction, a Work, in
    the BIBFRAME context, reflects the conceptual essence
  of the cataloged resource:  authors, languages, and what it is about (subjects).
  </em>
  <a href="https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/bibframe2-model.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>
  <h3>BIBFRAME Instance</h3>
  <strong>Definition</strong>:  <em>A Work may have one or more individual,
    material embodiments, for example, a particular published form. These are
    Instances of the Work.  An Instance reflects information such as its publisher,
    place and date of publication, and format.</em>
    <a href="https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/bibframe2-model.html" rel="nofollow">source</a></p>
  <h3>BIBFRAME Item</h3>
  <strong>Definition</strong>: <em>An item is an actual copy (physical or
    electronic) of an Instance. It reflects information
   such as its location (physical or virtual), shelf mark, and barcode.</em>
